Jet File Transfer is an application that allows you to easily share files and folders between devices connected to the same network without using the Internet. Desktop application is free for all desktop operating systems. Since two devices launched as server and client can find each other automatically, just press a button!

Starting with JDK 11, **JavaFX was removed from the official JDK distribution** and is no longer bundled by default. This means:

- Applications relying on JavaFX can no longer simply depend on the JDK to provide it.
- Developers must include JavaFX libraries separately, either by adding them as dependencies or bundling the necessary JavaFX runtime files with their applications.

## JavaFX in Java 8 and Earlier Versions

- In **JDK 8 and earlier**, JavaFX was included by default as part of the JDK.
- Applications built for Java 8 commonly rely on this built-in JavaFX runtime.
- If your application depends on JavaFX and targets Java 8, it will not run correctly on JDK 11+ without additional setup.

## Downloading Older JDK Versions Containing JavaFX

- Oracle provides archived downloads of older JDK versions (including Java 8), which **still contain JavaFX** as part of the JDK bundle.
- These older JDK releases are available on Oracleâ€™s official site at the Java SE 8 Archive:
